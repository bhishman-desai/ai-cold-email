Hello {{recipient_name}},

I'm a recent graduate from Dalhousie University with a Master’s in Applied Computer Science. I’d love to learn more about your team’s current priorities & challenges and explore how I might contribute.

Would you have 15-minute for a quick chat this or next week? I’m happy to work around your schedule.

P.S. I’ve automated this outreach, manual follow-ups don’t scale. But my interest is entirely genuine. If now’s not the right time, feel free to reply “Not now” and I’ll step back respectfully.

Sincerely,
Bhishman
